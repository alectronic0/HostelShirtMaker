## info
It make shirts...kind of

Code Built for Asylum Hostel Cairns to help organise there Tshirt Creation stuff...
Its a Simple VB Application.

## Original Requirement Brief
Nothing big. Should take someone who knows what they're doing less than 30minutes. I've seen how to do the basic folder creation, it would just be a few form fields.

It's to make the folders for the hostel shirts. I need a program that creates a folder (in the same directory of the program, wherever it is), and names it with form data input.

The form fields would be:
Party Date (yyyymmdd):
Name:
Room#:
Shirt type: (drop-down menu options: Singlet | T-Shirt |
Shirt size: (drop-down menu: XXS | XS | S | M | L | XL | XXL |

Output to folder name would be "<PartyDate> <Name> <Room> <ShirtType> <Size>"

example: "20170412 Joe #21 Singlet M"
